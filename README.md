# The Ninth Montreal Industrial Problem Solving Workshop
[The Ninth Montreal Industrial Problem Solving Workshop](http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/probindustriels/?lang=en) is organized jointly by the Centre de recherches mathématiques (CRM) and the Institute for Data Valorization (IVADO). The workshop will gather representatives from industry, academic mathematicians, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows. Participants will work in teams, each of which studying a concrete problem submitted by a company or a public or quasi-public institution. One of the goals of the workshop (IPSW) is to provide companies and institutions with mathematical tools for solving problems. An IPSW also allows professors and students in the mathematical sciences (including data science, statistics, optimization, mathematical finance, natural language processing, etc.) to analyze and solve real-world problems. The organizers view the workshop as an “incubator” of collaborations and hope that the work initiated during the workshop will lead to collaborations lasting several months or years.

The mandate of the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) is to develop and monitor the application of financial sector regulations for Québec companies and foreign companies offering their financial products in Québec. These regulations are available on the AMF web site. As an example, here are the regulations for securities.

These regulations have a structure similar to that of a piece of legislation and include in particular: (1) definitions of varied entities (for instance the definition of “derivative”); (2) some articles; (3) regulations and guidance; (4) references to other regulations or legislative pieces.

In order to abide by the regulations, the financial sector companies are invited to understand the regulations so as to ensure that they are correctly applied to their specific cases. At the present time this understanding exercise is mostly “manual,” whether one is looking for the relevant sections or ensuring that the company is complying with the law. Within each financial sector company there is a compliance department, which ensures that the company complies with all the regulations (whether the AMF regulations or those of other relevant institutions).

With the goal of lightening the regulatory burden, several projects have been launched in other countries by organizations similar to the AMF, in order to adapt regulations for an automated reading system. Here are two examples, from the United States and the United Kingdom (respectively).
